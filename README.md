# Software Development Using Machine Learning and Generative AI: Tech Challenge

This project includes three mini-apps demonstrating React, Streamlit, and LLM integration.

## Task 1: React App
A simple “Hello World” React application created using the latest React setup.

## Task 2: Streamlit App
A **Wine Recommender** built with `scikit-learn` and `Streamlit`, using a RandomForest model on the classic Wine dataset.  
Users adjust sliders to generate predictions and see class probabilities.

## Task 3: LLM Integration
Extended the Streamlit app with an **AI Chat Assistant** powered by the OpenAI API, allowing users to ask wine-related questions.

## AI & Vibe Coding
AI was used to debug dependency issues, manage storage, understand dataset features, and refine documentation clarity.  
All code implementation and experimentation were my own.

## Tech Stack
React • Streamlit • scikit-learn • OpenAI API • Python • JavaScript
